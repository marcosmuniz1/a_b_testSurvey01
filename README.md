# A/B testing in survey desing

### Testing the impact of design on response rates and survey performance

based on 200 responses from two alternative survey desings i'll assess wether there are statistically significant differences in a set of key survey performance indicators, namely:
- survey length
- response proportions
- bad response rate (answers are inconsistent and therefore cannot be used for analysis)
